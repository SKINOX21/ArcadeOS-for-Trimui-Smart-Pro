# Installation

First of all, I recommand you to use <a href="https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS"> Crossmix OS <a/>as OS, it's not an obligation but Crossmix is better on all points
<br>
This tutorial is made for the Crossmix OS user so if your not using it some point may be different.
<br>
During all this tuto, I will use the "TSP" word to say Trimui Smart Pro
<br>

## Theme
The theme installation is the easiest thing, you just have to unzip the release you download and copy the `ArcadeOS - Dark` file in the `Themes` file on the SD card of you TSP.
<br>
After this, you just have to eject the SD card and put back in your TSP.
<br>
Now you just have to go in theme and change the theme.
